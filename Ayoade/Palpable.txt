At this age, he is mostly fascinated with things right in front of him. Things he can reach out, touch, manipulate, and, eventually, put in his mouth.

His teeth begin to push through his gums. Despite what common sense might suggest, chewing comforts him. Eases his pain.

Soon, he learns to crawl. This serves him well, as it increases the number of things he can reach, and, thus, the number of things he can put in his mouth. His mastication continues.

Next, he stands. He walks. Now his range extends upwards. Soon, he can jump. He can climb. His range extends once more.

This is all to be expected, though. Typical. Predictable, even. What came next was anything but.
