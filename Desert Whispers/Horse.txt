The sheer amount of blood was surprising, to say the least. Only more surprising was that Taran was still conscious, or at least appeared to be.

"You ok, sir?"

The question shook Taran to a state of alert.

"You seem to be bleeding. A lot."

Taran opened his eyes, wincing as they adjusted to the morning sun. He responded, his voice dry and croaky.

"It's not exactly an ideal situation. Though I do think my shirt looks better in red. Got any water?"

The stranger, coming into focus now, reached up to Taran with a canteen, which Taran took gently in an attempt to mask his deperation. He removed the lid, took a generous sip (but a sip nonetheless), refastened the lid and handed it back to the stranger.

"No, friend, you keep it. You have a long ride ahead of you."

This confused Taran slightly. This stranger seemed to be acting as though he knew something of Taran and his destination. Taran had been riding for some time in an odd state of auto-pilot, due in no small part to the blood loss. Had the stranger been talking to him then? Had Taran been sleep-conversing with this man?

Taran tried to focus on the stranger in front of him. He concentrated on the man's face, but, as it came into focus, he realised he was looking at an unremarkable rock. Looking around, he could see no person or thing around him. Nothing but sand, bush and rocks till the horizon in each direction, and no tracks but his own.

He was definitely holding a canteen that wasn't his, so at least he hadn't imagined the whole thing.

Looking ahead, he noticed the sun was now behind him, his shadow stretching far ahead. It was now late afternoon, evening even, with some of the brighter stars just becoming visible ahead of him.
