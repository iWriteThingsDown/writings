No mirrors in the house
Afraid of what he might see
A sense of dignity that was strange in these lands
A sense of dignity that had no place in these lands


The boy's body was mostly intact, laying face-down just inside the front gate. There was a pronounced smear of blood on the gate itself, long dried and riddled with specs of sand that had been kicked up by the same wind that now caused a rattle along the house's tin roof that cascaded with every gust.

Taran pushed the gate open carefully as to touch the blood. Stepping around the boy's remains, he passed the gate and eased towards the main house, not wanting to either disturb or miss anything that might come to be important.

The front door, though definitely latched, was warped and misaligned. For a moment, he stopped and let his eyes fall away from the house and to an unremarkable distant hill. Taran did not know exactly what was inside the house, but knew there was much more and much worse than what he had encounted at the gate. Delaying the inevitable is a curious and impractical characteristic of human behaviour.

The deck creaked mercilessly as he shifted his weight onto it, the ambient sound filling the scene almost too perfectly. After a hefty nudge, the door swung open and revealed a dust-covered interior. As Taran stood, his eyes adjusting, a disturbing scene slowly emerged from the darkness. A child lay motionless in the centre of the room. It looked to be another boy. He was face-down with one arm by his side and the other seeming to reach out. Exposed to far fewer elements than the boy by the gate, this body was far better preserved.
