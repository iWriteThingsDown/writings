Ezekiel stood in the doorway of the chicken shed, staring at me. He was dressed in an appropriately sloppy manner considering the hour of four in the morning. He looked somewhat puzzled. He was almost exclusively on morning duty, a task he had jumped on entirely so he had the moral wherewithal to get out of afternoon tasks, freeing him up for such exciting activites as racing dirt bikes. His interests included, and were entirely limited to, dirt bikes, dirt, and bikes.

Ezekiel blinked a few times, likely trying to both bring the room into focus in his morning stupor and come to terms with his sister Mary (in case you've lost a few pages, that's me) not only awake, but actively performing responsible work.

"Um," came Ezekiel's first decisive utterance.

"Morning, brother!" I beamed back with an air of juvenile superiority.

I had specifically taken the early morning shift (earlier even than Ezekiel's crack-of-dawn routine) to clean the chicken coops so that I could pull Ezekiel's trick and get my quota of family business guilt out of the way as early as possible. While I do truly hate this work (and particulaly THIS work, being the early morning cleaning duties), I hated those 'I'm disappointed' talks from Dad even moreso, so this was the lesser of two evils. I'd timed this so I could finish up at about six-o-clock, have a quick shower, then race into town.

I'd already chosen my outfit, trying carefully to stick in the bounds of standing out, but not in a ridiculous manner. Washed out colours and conflicting patterns is what I'd decided on: a checkered red button-up shirt and faded jeans with a good amount of wear in them (though not enough to start looking like I simply couldn't afford new ones). I'd accessorised with a well-worn cowboy hat, some reasonably muddied-up boots, and some cattle-handling leather gloves, tucked away in my belt as one might actually stow them. I'd considered a bandana tied loosly around my neck, but didn't want to overdo it to the point of looking like a caricature. Ultimately, I felt as though I'd nailed the look of unfashionably redneck, but still striking enough to (hopefully) get noticed. 

Ezekiel stared further, still trying to come to terms with the situation. He clumsily reached out and placed his hand on the rough door frame, as though checking its texture as some kind of confirmation he wasn't dreaming.

"Hello," he uttered.

"Are you talking to me or the door?" I retorted quickly.

Ezekiel paused for a moment, seeming to genuinely consider the question.

"Both, I guess."

"Well, in that case, hello!"

Ezekiel exhaled audibly and further considered the situation, before deciding he needed to seek further clarity.

"Why?"

"Never you mind. I'm finishing up at six. Think you can manage?"

Again, Ezekiel paused, struggling to simultaneously consider the question and continue his mental wake-up routine. Eventually he kicked into gear, stepping into the shed, grabbing a shovel and getting stuck in.

"If we his this hard enough, we can be done not long after sunrise." Ezekiel's diction had improved, perhaps indicating he had more or less finished waking up.

I was a bit cautious of his energy, but chalked it up to him having his own plans he was keen to dig in to himself, so thought I best take advantage of the situation presented to me.

"I am surprised by this outcome but appreciate your enthusiasm."

It took another few hours, but I finally managed to leave the shed in a state I thought reasonable enough to have some ammunition for the inevitable questions from Dad later this evening. Nevermind that, though; that was a problem for later-this-evening-Mary to deal with. For the moment, it was all about achieving an excellent look and getting to that test shooting, or whatever Douglas had called it. I was on such a roll from powering through the morning duties -- Ezekiel's surprising amount of early morning energy had actually helped out and added to my momentum -- that I managed to find myself saddling Roy and on my way out ten minutes ahead of schedule.

"I wonder if Chip is awake at this hour," I wondered aloud to myself.

I realised that, in the years I'd been talking with Chip, I don't think I'd ever seen him in the morning since I'd gotten to know him. It was only in that moment that I recognised his greeting of 'morning' every time he saw me was a joke. Being a classic teenage case (or so Dad seems to tell me), I've not really experienced the world before 10am in quite some time. Further still, I don't think I'd left the house before midday since ... well I couldn't really remember since. I remember Dad dragging me up on some early mornings to try to show me bits and pieces about the farm, but I maintain I remained mostly asleep during these demonstrations.

This only furthered the pep in my step, as I realised I'd potentially get a good chance to give Chip a good surprise by greeing him not long after the sun had risen. For all I knew, he'd be asleep himself. Perhaps he had a similar waking time to me, and I'd just never noticed, though I somehow doubted that. Chip, while energetic and jovial, seemed the type that was of the 'early to bed and early to rise' generation. I'm not even sure if that's a generational thing or just an age thing, but, regardless, I got the feeling he saw more sunrises than shooting stars.

As I rounded the corner towards Chip, I didn't immediately see any activity, nor hear anything other than the faraway rhythmic rumble of a choir of tractors seeming to come from all directions. I found it surprising at how calm and relaxing the sound truly was, considering it was ultimately a chorus of loud and unwieldy machines. I grew an appreciation for the early morning I knew I'd almost certainly forget by tomorrow morning. I could just see myself now, setting my alarm for the crack of dawn, only to immediately silence it with the thought of "I already did that once."

As I closed in towards Chips boat, his head popped up from behind one of the stands, with what looked like sandpaper in his hand. Despite having access to an arsenal of powertools and equipment in his fabled Farm Barn (Chip and I had debated many times as to whether these words rhymed), Chip preferred to work as manually as he could, feeling as though it helped him appreciate his own work better. My understanding was that he owned a lot of gear but wasn't game to admit he didn't know how to use it, but each to their own, I guess.

"Mornin', Chicken Rider!" Chip called out, enthusiastically.

"Chip. Good mornin' for it." I replied.

"Good morning for what?" Chip looked amusingly confused.

"I don't know. I'm not sure how people talk to one another this time of morning. Congratulations on greeting me when it was actually morning, for one."

"We should celebrate the occasion, though mayhaps on your way back. You look like you're on a mission."

"A mission, indeed. Turns out those vague rumours were fantascially true. I'll have to buy you a beer."

"I don't drink beer."

"A whiskey."

"Don't drink whiskey."

"A nice Merlot?"

"I'm not even sure what that is."

The brief gap in conversation was puncuated only by Roy's slow, meandering hooves on the dirt road.

"How about some tea on your way back?" Chip's usual offer.

"I might not be coming back till dark, if I play my cards right."

"Ain't no-one said you can't drink tea after dark. I'll see you later tonight, then, Chicken Rider. You can pay me back with an autograph."

"I don't know if that's going to be a fair trade come nightfall, Chip. I could be a mega-star by then."

"If that's the case, I'll make you two cups of tea."

"It's a deal, Chip. I'll catch you later," I called back to him, as he waved me off and got back to his delicate sanding.


Town was busier than I was anticipating, though still noticably quiet. Looking about, I noticed a few locals and we exchanged casual country-style nods, while I also received a decent serving of queried looks from those who recognised me. I could immediately identify the out-of-towners that were definitely part of the film crew. Like Douglas yesterday, they all wore clothes that were too neat and clean for Wellsprings, and all walked in his same leaning-forwards-almost-falling-over manner. I shuffled casually in their general direction, upping upping Roy's speed to a light canter so I could overtake a few in an attempt to spot Douglas. It was a difficult task, though, as they all looked remarkably similar. A few looked almost identical, to the point that I wondered if it was intentional or if I just had a poor eye for telling such folks apart.

I gave up before long, instead choosing
