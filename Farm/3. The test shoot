Zeke stood in the doorway of the chicken shed, staring at me. He was dressed in an appropriately sloppy manner considering the hour of four in the morning. He looked somewhat puzzled. He was almost exclusively on morning duty, a task he had jumped on entirely so he had the moral wherewithal to get out of afternoon tasks, freeing him up for such exciting activites as racing dirt bikes. His interests included, and were entirely limited to, dirt bikes, dirt, and bikes.

Zeke blinked a few times, likely trying to both bring the room into focus in his morning stupor and work out what was happening. 

"Um," came Zeke's first decisive utterance.

"Morning, brother!" I beamed back with an air of juvenile superiority.

"Oh. The film thing. Yeah." The penny finally dropping with Early-Morning-Zeke.

I had specifically taken the early morning shift (earlier even than Zeke's crack-of-dawn routine) to clean the chicken coops so that I could pull Zeke's trick and get my quota of family business guilt out of the way as early as possible. While I do truly hate this work (and particulaly THIS work, being the early morning cleaning duties), I hated those 'I'm disappointed' talks from Dad even moreso, so this was the lesser of two evils. I'd timed this so I could finish up at about six-o-clock, have a quick shower, then race into town.

I'd already chosen my outfit, trying carefully to stick in the bounds of standing out, but not in a ridiculous manner. Washed out colours and conflicting patterns is what I'd decided on: a checkered red button-up shirt and faded jeans with a good amount of wear in them (though not enough to start looking like I simply couldn't afford new ones). I'd accessorised with a well-worn cowboy hat, some reasonably muddied-up boots, and some cattle-handling leather gloves, tucked away in my belt as one might actually stow them. I'd considered a bandana tied loosly around my neck, but didn't want to overdo it to the point of looking like a caricature. Ultimately, I felt as though I'd nailed the look of unfashionably redneck, but still striking enough to (hopefully) get noticed. 

Zeke stared further, still trying to come to terms with the situation. He clumsily reached out and placed his hand on the rough door frame, as though checking its texture as some kind of confirmation he wasn't dreaming.

"Hello," he uttered.

"Are you talking to me or the door?" I retorted quickly.

Zeke paused for a moment, seeming to genuinely consider the question.

"Both, I guess."

"Well, in that case, hello!"

Again, Zeke paused, exhaled audibly and continued his mental wake-up routine. He looked about, taking note of what had and what hadn't been done yet (including what had been done, but hadn't been done "his way". Zeke was a bit of a perfectionist at the oddest of times). There were a lot of hmm's and huh's as he looked about the place, still standing in the doorway, weirdly stroking the door frame.

"OKAY!" he exulted, shocking me with both his volume and sudden explosive enthusiasm. Zeke kicked into gear, stepping into the shed, grabbing a shovel and striding towards a pile of chicken feed. "If we his this hard enough, we can be done not long after sunrise." Zeke's diction had improved, perhaps indicating he had more or less finished waking up.

I was a bit cautious of his energy, but chalked it up to him having his own plans he was keen to dig in to himself, so thought I best take advantage of the situation presented to me.

"I am surprised by this outcome but appreciate your enthusiasm."

It took another few hours, but I finally managed to leave the shed in a state I thought reasonable enough to have some ammunition for the inevitable questions from Dad later this evening. Nevermind that, though; that was a problem for later-this-evening-Mary to deal with. For the moment, it was all about achieving an excellent look and getting to that test shooting, or whatever Douglas had called it. I was on such a roll from powering through the morning duties -- Zeke's surprising amount of early morning energy had actually helped out and added to my momentum -- that I managed to find myself saddling Roy and on my way out ten minutes ahead of schedule.



Wellsprings was busier than I was anticipating, though still noticably quiet. Looking about, I noticed a few locals and we exchanged casual country-style nods, a few accompanied this with a slightly quizzical look. I'd not really been seen much outside before midday, so was certainly not one of the morning regulars.

I could immediately identify the out-of-towners that were definitely part of the film crew. Like Douglas yesterday, they all wore clothes that were too neat and clean for Wellsprings, and all walked in his same leaning-forwards-almost-falling-over manner. I shuffled casually in their general direction, upping my speed so I could overtake a few in an attempt to spot Douglas. It was a difficult task, though, as they all looked remarkably similar. A few looked almost identical, to the point that I wondered if it was intentional or if I just had a poor eye for telling folks like these apart.
