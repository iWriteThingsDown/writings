Ezekiel stood in the doorway of the chicken shed, staring at me. He was dressed in an appropriately sloppy manner considering the hour of four in the morning. He looked somewhat puzzled. He was almost exclusively on morning duty, a task he had jumped on entirely so he had the moral wherewithal to get out of afternoon tasks, freeing him up for such exciting activites as racing dirt bikes. His interests included, and were entirely limited to, dirt bikes, dirt, and bikes.

Ezekiel blinked a few times, likely trying to both bring the room into focus in his morning stupor and come to terms with his sister Mary (in case you've lost a few pages, that's me) not only awake, but actively performing responsible work.

"Um," came Ezekiel's first decisive utterance.

"Morning, brother!" I beamed back with an air of juvenile superiority.

I had specifically taken the early morning shift (earlier even than Ezekiel's crack-of-dawn routine) to clean the chicken coops so that I could pull Ezekiel's trick and get my quota of family business guilt out of the way as early as possible. While I do truly hate this work (and particulaly THIS work, being the early morning cleaning duties), I hated those 'I'm disappointed' talks from Dad even moreso, so this was the lesser of two evils. I'd timed this so I could finish up at about six-o-clock, have a quick shower, then race into town. I'd already chosen my outfit, trying carefully to stick in the bounds of standing out, but not in a ridiculous manner. Washed out colours and conflicting patterns is what I'd decided on: unfashionably redneck, but still striking enough to (hopefully) get noticed. 

Ezekiel stared further, still trying to come to terms with the situation. He clumsily reached out and placed his hand on the rough door frame, as though checking its texture as some kind of confirmation he wasn't dreaming.

"Hello," he uttered.

"Are you talking to me or the door?" I retorted quickly.

Ezekiel paused for a moment, seeming to genuinely consider the question.

"Both, I guess."

"Well, in that case, hello!"

Ezekiel exhaled audibly and further considered the situation, before deciding he needed to seek further clarity.

"Why?"

"Never you mind. I'm finishing up at six. Think you can manage?"

Again, Ezekiel paused, struggling to simultaneously consider the question and continue his mental wake-up routine. Eventually he kicked into gear, stepping into the shed, grabbing a shovel and beginning his own morning checklist.

"I'm sure I can manage," is the only response he could manage.

We continued working together in relative harmony for another thirty or so minutes before Ezekiel snapped to cognizance.

"Wait. What have you done already?"

It took another few hours, but I finally managed to leave the shed in a state I thought reasonable enough to have some ammunition for the inevitable questions from Dad later this evening. Nevermind that, though; that was a problem for later-this-evening-Mary to deal with. For the moment, it was all about achieving an excellent look and getting to that test shooting, or whatever Douglas had called it. I was on such a roll from powering through the morning duties -- Ezekiel had surprisingly helped out and added to my momentum -- that I managed to find myself saddling Roy and on my way out ten minutes ahead of schedule.

"I wonder if Chip is awake at this hour," I wondered aloud to myself.

I realised that, in the years I'd been talking with Chip, I don't think I'd ever seen him in the morning since I'd gotten to know him. It was only in that moment that I recognised his greeting of 'morning' every time he saw me was a joke. Being a classic teenage case (or so Dad seems to tell me), I've not really experienced the world before 10am in quite some time. Further still, I don't think I'd left the house before midday since ... well I couldn't really remember since. I remember Dad dragging me up on some early mornings to try to show me bits and pieces about the farm, but I maintain I remained mostly asleep during these demonstrations.

This only furthered the pep in my step, as I realised I'd potentially get a good chance to give Chip a good surprise by greeing him not long after the sun had risen. For all I knew, he'd be asleep himself. Perhaps he had a similar waking time to me, and I'd just never noticed, though I somehow doubted that. Chip, while energetic and jovial, seemed the type that was of the 'early to bed and early to rise' generation. I'm not even sure if that's a generational thing or just an age thing, but, regardless, I got the feeling he saw more sunrises than shooting stars.
