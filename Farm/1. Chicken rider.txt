The rusted wrought-iron sign above the rusted wrought-iron gate read “Harry Palmer the Chicken Farmer”.

Well I guess it’s mostly accurate. He more accurately farms eggs, but “egg farmer” gives the impression of some clueless weirdo attempting to grow eggs out in a field somewhere, or trying desperately to make eggs mate with one another, so “chicken farmer” it is. Chicken farmer is itself an odd career move 

Harry is my Dad, and this is the family farm he bought ten years ago. Before that, we ran a cheap motel, which was definitely a lot more work, and surprisingly messier. I’m ok with helping out here on the farm, but it’s definitely not where I want to be for the rest of my life. My older brother, Ezekiel, is a lot more into it than I am, but I suspect, however, that Dad thinks my brother’s name doesn’t lend as well to the rhythm of the farm name. “Ezekiel Palmer the Chicken Farmer” just doesn’t sound as good as it would with "Mary Palmer". And so, thanks to my venerable two-syllable name, I am apparently the key to the farm's future.

I do my best to help out on the farm without actually being on the farm, so I’m the first to volunteer for pick-ups, deliveries, or anything else that requires working somewhere that smells a bit better than a warehouse full of chickens, or a house full of people who work night and day in a warehouse full of chickens.

On these trips, I also do my best to find a reason to go on horse instead of the truck. For one thing, this means the trips take a bit longer, allowing me to spend a greater deal on time not on the farm. Secondly, the truck, being used by career chicken farmers for chicken-farming purposes, is not in a fit state to be used by someone without an affinity for chicken farming. Or egg farming. Or whatever.

Thirdly, of course, is my oh-so-serious ambition to be a real cowboy. I'm still working on the name. In fact, I like to use slow, meandering horse rides to ponder such important questions. I've already decided I need to drop the "Palmer" part. It's too well-known, and I don't want people humming the stupid jingle when they hear my name. Current leading contenders include "Mary Ryder", "Mary du Boir" (which means "wood" in French, but who cares?) and "Three-Eyed Mary". I'm not sure where that last one even came from; my limited exposure to radiation has left me with a mere two eyes, but I nonetheless like the sound of it.

Ezekiel, while generally supportive of my dreams, has bastardised my front-runner with the monicker "Mary the Chicken Rider", based on a very early childhood incident where I was playing cowboy with some of the stock. Ezekiel hadn't even been there at the time, but, unfortunately, video evidence still exists of this incident, despite my best efforts.

And before you ask: yes, I do plan on being a female cowboy. Cowgirl, as I discovered only at the embarrassingly mature age of 17, has a much more common definition that doesn't really fit with the direction I plan on focusing my life. I can still hear Ezekiel squealing with laughter when I announced to the family my intentions of "going full cowgirl". Needless to say, I have continued to follow these aspirations with just a slight linguistic shift. Enough said. Let's move on.

Today's journey to town was to pick up some motor oil to replenish our supplies. We'd been going through a bit more than usual thanks to some less than ideal maintenance of our main tractor. 

Speaking of horse, I should probably not be so rude and introduce you to him. The sensibly-named Roy is our slowest moving and tiredest looking mount. He is most often found sleep-swaying in the back paddock or sauntering into town with me astride. Roy has been with us for years. He actually came with the farm when Dad bought it a good 10 years back, and he was old and slow then. Since then, he's only slowed further and slept longer.

The trail into town passed by another farm, one belonging to Chip Mulaney, an eccentric war hero with a hundred good yarns up his sleeve and a gift for telling them. Chip had decided he was too old for farming, and instead chose to simply rent out his land to whoever offered. These days, he spent most of his time working on his small yacht, which sat upon wooden stands in his yard. Considering the landscape of mostly dirt and sand as far as the eye could see in every direction, the boat stood out as particularly odd. I'm not even sure where the nearest body of water even was where he could sail it, but definitely further than I'd ever been. Come to think of it, I'm not even sure how that boat got here.

"Mornin' there, Chicken Rider," Chip called out. He was very supportive of my cowboy ambitions, and was actually the one to coin "Mary Ryder", which he used right up until he heard Ezekiel's alternative, which was now his favourite.

"It's two in the afternoon, Chip."

"It was mornin' not too long ago. We all know I'm a little slow. No need to point it out."

"I guess I outta be thinkin' 'bout movin' on, here," I replied, cheekily mocking his Southern drawl.

"I hope you're not makin' fun o' me there, Chicken Rider."

"I simply wouldn't dream o' that, Chip."

"Say, dreamer, you wouldn't happen to know anything about film they're shooting out by the wind farm."

"Film? Someone's making a film ... here?"

"Cowboy film."

I tried to contain the sudden onslaught of butterflies in my stomach, clearly not well enough to get by Chip though, who, in turn, managed to supresss his hearty laugh into a light chuckle.

Chip continued: "Anyway, that's probably not the sort of thing a girl would be in to. You probably want rainbows and unicorns and things. Best avoid that whole area at, say, seven-o-clock tomorrow morning."

"Nine-o-clock tomorrow?" My voice awkwardly shook as I tried to maintain composure.

"Nine-o-clock tomorrow. Sal down at the general store knows more about it than I do. His cousin's the one what's brought them all here."

"Sal at the general store," now just making audible mental notes for myself.

"Just don't forget the motor oil you were sent it town to get, else your Daddy might suspect somethin'."

"Ok, Sherlock. How do you know I was getting motor oil?" Chip had a strange way of knowing everything that was going on around him, to the point that many in town would mockingly refer to him as The Mayor.

"I can hear that tractor of yours. Needs more than just oil, you know."

"I know, but oil is all we're giving it right now."

"Poor thing. Just breaks a man's heart."

"How about I'll see if there's anything else I can pick up at the general store."

"Now what would you be doin' at the general store if you're just meant to be picking up motor oil?"

Our voices were becoming more and more raised as I sauntered past and further away from Chip and his boat.

"I'll see if I can get something to fix your broken heart."

"Ain't nothing they sell in this town that could do that, Mary."

"I'm sorry to hear that."

Chip chuckled his classic hearty chuckle, before he called out to get the final word:

"Don't you be sayin' sorry unless you mean it, Chicken Rider."
