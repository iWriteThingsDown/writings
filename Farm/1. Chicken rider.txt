The rusted wrought-iron sign above the rusted wrought-iron gate read “Harry Palmer the Chicken Farmer”.

Well I guess it’s mostly accurate. He more accurately farms eggs, but “egg farmer” gives the impression of some clueless weirdo attempting to grow eggs out in a field somewhere, or trying desperately to make eggs mate with one another, so “chicken farmer” it is.

Harry is my Dad, and this is the family farm. I’m ok with helping out here, but it’s definitely not where I want to be for the rest of my life. My brother’s a lot more into it than I am, but Dad’s says it’s important that the first-born – that being me – continue in the family business. I suspect, however, that my brother’s name doesn’t lend as well to the rhythm of the farm. “Ezekiel Palmer the Chicken Farmer” just doesn’t sound quite right.

I do my best to help out on the farm without actually being on the farm, so I’m the first to volunteer for pick-ups, deliveries, or anything else that requires working somewhere that smells a bit better than a warehouse full of chickens, or a house full of people who work night and day in the aforementioned warehouse full of chickens.

On these trips, I also do my best to find a reason to go on horse instead of the truck. For one thing, this means the trips take a bit longer, allowing me to spend a greater deal on time not on the farm. Secondly, the truck, being used by career chicken farmers for chicken-farming purposes, is not in a fit state to be used by someone without an affinity for chicken farming. Or egg farming. Or whatever.

Thirdly, of course, is my oh-so-serious ambition to be a real cowboy. I'm still working on the name. In fact, I like to use slow, meandering horse rides to ponder such important questions. I've already decided I need to drop the "Palmer" part. It's too well-known, and I don't want people humming the stupid jingle when they hear my name. Current leading contenders include "Mary Ryder" and "Three-Eyed Mary" (I don't have three eyes, but I have two excellent ones).

Ezekiel, while generally supportive of my dreams, has given me the monicker "Mary the Chicken Rider", based on a very early childhood incident where I was playing cowboy with some of the stock. Ezekiel hadn't even been born at this stage, but, unfortunately, video evidence exists of this incident.

And before you ask: yes, I do plan on being a female cowboy. Cowgirl, as I was shocked to discover at the embarrassingly old age of 19, is a sex position, and not really the direction I plan on focusing my life. I can still hear Ezekiel squealing with laughter when I announced to the family my intentions of "going full cowgirl". Needless to say, I have continued to follow these aspirations with just a slight linguistic shift. Enough said. Let's move on.
