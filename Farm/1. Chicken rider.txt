The rusted wrought-iron sign above the rusted wrought-iron gate read “Harry Palmer the Chicken Farmer”.

Well I guess it’s mostly accurate. He more accurately farms eggs, but “egg farmer” gives the impression of some clueless weirdo attempting to grow eggs out in a field somewhere, or trying desperately to make eggs mate with one another, so “chicken farmer” it is. Chicken farmer is itself an odd career move 

Harry is my Dad, and this is the family farm. I’m ok with helping out here, but it’s definitely not where I want to be for the rest of my life. My brother, Ezekiel, is a lot more into it than I am, but Dad’s says it’s important that the first-born – that being me – continue in the family business. I suspect, however, that my brother’s name doesn’t lend as well to the rhythm of the farm. “Ezekiel Palmer the Chicken Farmer” just doesn’t sound as good as it would with "Mary Palmer". And so, thanks to my venerable two-syllable name, I am apparently the key to the farm's future.

I do my best to help out on the farm without actually being on the farm, so I’m the first to volunteer for pick-ups, deliveries, or anything else that requires working somewhere that smells a bit better than a warehouse full of chickens, or a house full of people who work night and day in a warehouse full of chickens.

On these trips, I also do my best to find a reason to go on horse instead of the truck. For one thing, this means the trips take a bit longer, allowing me to spend a greater deal on time not on the farm. Secondly, the truck, being used by career chicken farmers for chicken-farming purposes, is not in a fit state to be used by someone without an affinity for chicken farming. Or egg farming. Or whatever.

Thirdly, of course, is my oh-so-serious ambition to be a real cowboy. I'm still working on the name. In fact, I like to use slow, meandering horse rides to ponder such important questions. I've already decided I need to drop the "Palmer" part. It's too well-known, and I don't want people humming the stupid jingle when they hear my name. Current leading contenders include "Mary Ryder", "Mary du Boir" (which means "wood" in French, but who cares?) and "Three-Eyed Mary". I'm not sure where that last one even came from; my limited exposure to radiation has left me with a mere two eyes, but I nonetheless like the sound of it.

Ezekiel, while generally supportive of my dreams, has given me the monicker "Mary the Chicken Rider", based on a very early childhood incident where I was playing cowboy with some of the stock. Ezekiel hadn't even been born at this stage, but, unfortunately, video evidence still exists of this incident, despite my best efforts.

And before you ask: yes, I do plan on being a female cowboy. Cowgirl, as I discovered only at the embarrassingly mature age of 19, has a much more common definition that doesn't really fit with the direction I plan on focusing my life. I can still hear Ezekiel squealing with laughter when I announced to the family my intentions of "going full cowgirl". Needless to say, I have continued to follow these aspirations with just a slight linguistic shift. Enough said. Let's move on.

Today's journey to town was to pick up some motor oil to replenish our supplies. We'd been going through a bit more than usual due to the higher temperatures of late. While I could have taken the van and gotten enough oil for the whole summer in one trip, taking the horse meant I couldn't load up on as much, meaning more trips were required, meaning more time moseying to and from town to be mostly alone with my thoughts.

Speaking of horse, I should probably not be so rude and introduce you to him. The sensibly-named Roy is our slowest moving and tiredest looking mount. He is most often found sleep-swaying in the back paddock or sauntering into town with me astride. Roy has been with us for years. He actually came with the farm when Dad bought it a good 10 years back, and he was old and slow then. Since then, he's only slowed further and slept longer.

The trail into town passed by another farm, one belonging to Chip Mulaney, an eccentric war hero with a hundred good yarns up his sleeve and a gift for telling them. He'd managed to automate most of his farm, bit by bit, over the years, and would now usually be found fulfilling a redneck stereotype by sitting on his front porch and "hollering passers-by", as he liked to put it.

"Mornin' there, Chicken Rider," Chip called out. He was very supportive of my cowboy ambitions, and liked my moniker of "Mary Ryder" up till he heard Ezekiel's alternative, which was now his favourite.

"It's two in the afternoon, Chip."

"Yeah but mornin' sounds better. Where you off to?"

"Well I gotta gets me some motor oil for some of our old rickety machines, there," I replied, cheekily mocking his Southern drawl.

"I hope you're not makin' fun o' me there, Chicken Rider. You don't wanna see what happened to the last guy what made that mistake."

"I simply wouldn't dream o' that, Chip."

Chip was also a fan of Roy, as he had a very consistent walk. Whenever we'd ride past, Chip would reach for his beat-up guitar and pluck away at some musing or another. Nothing too fancy; Chip liked to keep things simple, just adding some extra sound to fill the ambience, and pass the time watching the world go by.
