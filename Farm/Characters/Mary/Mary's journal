Mary's Journal
--------------

Here is my latest brilliant poem. I spent upwards of minutes painstakingly crafting this. I didn't pour any blood or tears into it, but there is definitely sweat, because it was fucking hot today.

	The sun rises
	I do some stuff
	The sun sets

I think it really speaks to my incredibly exciting existence.

	His blood was bright in colour
