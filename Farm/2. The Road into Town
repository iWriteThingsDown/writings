Wellsprings was a town that stood as the very definition of boring. One main street, one tavern, one general store, really one of just about everything. This was a town where interesting people and things came to settle down into a life of repetition and monotony. If you've ever experienced that feeling where every day is exactly the same and wanted to make a town based on that phrase, this town wouldn't be it, because that would be too interesting. 

When something even slightly interesting does happen around here, the locals tend to become a little ... unhinged. The last time a travelling salesman visited, the frightening level of excitement the townsfolk exhibited disturbed him to the point that he is now a priest in the next county.

With that in mind, Wellsprings wasn't quite as abuzz as I thought it might be after hearing the news of a film. In fact, town was unpleasantly normal. Part of me began to suspect that perhaps Chip had misheard or misinterpreted something much more mundane and ordinary and gotten my hopes up to high heaven.

With a reserved sigh, I pulled up to Ollie's Gas Station and hitched Roy to a convenient post.

"Mary! What can I do ye for?"

"Motor oil, thanks Ollie."

"That tractor at it again?" Ollie was always keen for a chat, but today I was on something of an autopilot while my mind still raced with the still slight possibility of a cowboy film within spitting distance of me.

"Uh huh."

My inner cogs suddenly shifted into position as I realised I was mid-conversation with someone who would regularly talk with just about everyone in town. There aren't many souls about that don't run some kind of motor or engine, and Ollie's the best around to keep everything mechanical in order.

"Say, Ollie, you wouldn't know anything about this film, would you?"

"Film?"

Ollie was quizzical and somewhat intrigued, as he often became when he was hearing something for the first time, thus dashing my hopes just a bit further. For all I could think, there was a kid on the street with a handheld film camera and a lengthy game of Chinese Whispers had escalated into a blockbuster motion film.

Ollie continued, "I haven't heard nothing about a film. Where'd you hear that?"

"Chip," I blurted out before remembering the strange animosity many in town had towards Chip.

"Ha! Chip! There's a good one!"

I immediately decided I had had enough of this conversation. Clearly I wasn't going to learn anything I didn't already know here.

"Yep. Thought as much."

"Chip! He should write children's books with that imagination of his."

Already at this point the townspeople's jokes would repeat themselves when it came to Chip. This was what always struck me as strange about this popular disapproval of all things Chip: it was always just the same "that crazy guy" jokes over and over again. With that in mind, I was usually pretty good at keeping a lid on any mention of him, and this slip-up was a situation I was immediately concerned with removing myself from.

"Ok thanks, Ollie."

"I mean, Chip, really? I still don't know how you believe anything that guy says."

"I know, he keeps telling me your prices are the best in town. I should really just switch over to the general store like everyone else."

Ollie lived in constant fear of the general store expanding into some kind of superstore that sold everyting and putting him out of business. I don't enjoy inflicting discomfort on others, really, but I was already sick of this conversation before it started. My mind was still dancing elsewhere with the ever-diminishing possibility of something actually exciting happening and this conversation was already proving much less useful than I'd hoped. The rest of the transaction was made in silence. I'd made my point, I guess. I returned to Roy, loaded up with a quart of oil, and made my way to the general store.

There was a distracting inner battle betwen my suddenly over-stimulated imagination and the growing feeling that there was nothing happening at all, as per Wellsprings tradition. Passing through the main intersection in town (you know your town is small when you have something that can be described as 'the main intersection'),
