Wellsprings was a town that stood as the very definition of boring. One main street, one tavern, one general store, really one of just about everything. This was a town where interesting people and things came to settle down into a life of repetition and monotony. If you've ever experienced that feeling where every day is exactly the same and wanted to make a town based on that phrase, this town wouldn't be it, because that would be too interesting. 

When something even slightly interesting does happen around here, the locals tend to become a little ... unhinged. The last time a travelling salesman visited, the frightening level of excitement the townsfolk exhibited disturbed him to the point that he is now a priest in the next county.

With that in mind, Wellsprings wasn't quite as abuzz as I thought it might be after hearing the news of a film. In fact, town was unpleasantly normal. Part of me began to suspect that perhaps Chip had misheard or misinterpreted something much more mundane and ordinary and gotten my hopes up to high heaven.

With a reserved sigh, I pulled up to Ollie's Gas Station and hitched Roy to a convenient post.

"Mary! What can I do ye for?"

"Motor oil, thanks Ollie."

"That tractor at it again?" Ollie was always keen for a chat, but today I was on something of an autopilot while my mind still raced with the still slight possibility of a cowboy film within spitting distance of me.

"Uh huh."

My inner cogs suddenly shifted into position as I realised I was mid-conversation with someone who would regularly talk with just about everyone in town. There aren't many souls about that don't run some kind of motor or engine, and Ollie's the best around to keep everything mechanical in order.

"Say, Ollie, you wouldn't know anything about this film, would you?"

"Film?"

Ollie was quizzical and somewhat intrigued, as he often became when he was hearing something for the first time, thus dashing my hopes just a bit further. For all I could think, there was a kid on the street with a handheld film camera and a lengthy game of Chinese Whispers had escalated into a blockbuster motion film.

Ollie continued, "I haven't heard nothing about a film. Where'd you hear that?"

"Chip," I blurted out before remembering the strange animosity many in town had towards Chip.

"Ha! Chip! There's a good one!"

I immediately decided I had had enough of this conversation. Clearly I wasn't going to learn anything I didn't already know here.

"Yep. Thought as much."

"Chip! He should write children's books with that imagination of his."

Already at this point the townspeople's jokes would repeat themselves when it came to Chip. This was what always struck me as strange about this popular disapproval of all things Chip: it was always just the same "that crazy guy" jokes over and over again. With that in mind, I was usually pretty good at keeping a lid on any mention of him, and this slip-up was a situation I was immediately concerned with removing myself from.

"Ok thanks, Ollie."

"I mean, Chip, really? I still don't know how you believe anything that guy says."

"I know, he keeps telling me your prices are the best in town. I should really just switch over to the general store like everyone else."

Ollie lived in constant fear of the general store expanding into some kind of superstore that sold everyting and putting him out of business. I don't enjoy inflicting discomfort on others, really, but I was already sick of this conversation before it started. My mind was still dancing elsewhere with the ever-diminishing possibility of something actually exciting happening and this conversation was already proving much less useful than I'd hoped. The rest of the transaction was made in silence. I'd made my point, I guess. I returned to Roy, loaded up with a quart of oil, and made my way to the general store.

There was a distracting inner battle betwen my suddenly over-stimulated imagination and the growing feeling that there was nothing happening at all, as per Wellsprings tradition. Passing through the intersection (you know your town is small when you have something that can be described as 'the intersection'), everything seemed normal, and by normal, I of course mean boring. The same music ("music") eminating from the tavern, the same horses hitched up out front. The same deputy sitting in the same chair outside the sheriff's office, and probably the same drunk waking up in the cell from the night prior.

Reaching the general store, I was in two minds as to whether head in and investigate Chip's claim, or just U-turn back home and forget the whole affair. A brief vision into Chip's teasing and (likely honest) disappointment on the way home crossed my mind. I could take the long way home and avoid crossing paths with him, but I'd not be able to avoid him forever. Somehow, in the moment, that thought made it easier to persist and risk more embarrasment of the like I experienced with Ollie.

As I was just about to dismount, a character caught my eye. One thing about living in a small town of nothingness is that you can spot an outsider a mile away. Visitors from neighbouring small towns have their tells, but folk from farther afield fit in like a pig with a cravat. A young man, probably not much older than me, was walking out of the general store itself. While he was, I guess, wearing clothing that was appropraite to the area, it was quite obviously brand new, spotless, and freshly ironed. His brown leather boots were particularly egrigious: they were not only spotless, but had a sheen that could double as a mirror. In fact, the very first thing that brought him to my attention was the sun blindingly reflecting off his boots as he walked.

A strange thing about being a well-established local in a country town speaking to an out-of-towner is that you develop a very particular sort of confidence. With that under my belt, I blurted in a very uncharacteristic coherency at him: "What are you filming?"

There was no certainty that there was any filming involved here. For all I knew, this was just a newcomer in town, or a visiting relative of a local, but that peculiar confidence spoke for me and didn't care about the possibility of being mistaken.

"Uh ... what? Ma'am?"

I'd clearly caught him off-guard and broken his strike. Likely, he had been dreaming of making one undisturbed trip to the general store; a simple wish for a mundane task that I had just shattered for the poor boy.

"You're making a film."

The 'local confidence' started to slip away a bit as I ventured further into the possibility I could be altogether wrong here. I felt an impending wave of dreadful embarrassment forming in my peripherals. The advantage of my situation, I tried to assure myself, was that if I was wrong, I could just keep on riding and never see him again. If he was new in town, I guess I could just keep riding into the next town and start a new life. As he opened his mouth to reply, I found myself sharply holding my breath.

"Yes."

And with that, it seemed all my fears and worries drifted away for a moment. There is something about a risk paying off that gives a feeling of euphoria that can't be achieved by anything else I've yet encountered in life. Overly dramatic as it may be, just let me celebrate this moment will you? These small victories are few and far between, so I like to envelop myself in them whenever the opportunity presents itself.

Where I was previously trying to stop my voice shaking out of fear, I was now trying to contain my voice shaking from excitement.

"Go on."

"We're doing test footage for a western movie, out by the wind turbines."

"Test footage?"

"Uh ... yeah. We might be filming here later on, so we do some shoots to make sure the location will work."

I left a nice, stagnant pause without breaking eye contact.

"Right."

A longer, less intentional pause followed here. I realised I didn't quite know how to proceeed, but tried a shot in the dark for good measure. An introduction is in order, perhaps.

"I am Ma-" wait: this is where I need to choose a moniker. Here is a moment where I can actually use it with someone I haven't already run into a thousand times, and someone who might actually carry it on to someone interesting.

"...-ry."

Good one, Mary. That was suave.
