Cailley

20s/30s
a vet previously hired by Patrick to investigate the elk deaths on Promentory
she had an affair with an older co-worker, a well-respected vet that she worked for
she fell pregnant and the affair became public. Many in the town blamed her almost entirely for the affair
she eventually had a termination, which only then turned her religious family further against her. They disowned her and cast her out
as a result of this, she has serious abandonment issues
she also has a serious dislike/distrust of religious people and their beliefs/customs
fear of failure: often fails to commit to decisions or diagnoses before she is 100% certain


Mistakes/dishonesties:



Stakes/wants:



How I view myself:
a disappointment/failure
an outcast


How I view the world:
everyone is only in it for themselves, even those who act nice (anti-altruistic)
i.e. severe trust issues
