Victor

crime scene investigator and forensic scientist
separated but not divorced from his wife
he had delayed on a case that resulted in the death of several people, including a child
he and his wife endured several miscarriages
after finally having a child, it only lived for several hours
Victor was looking forward to having a child, and began to slip further and further into depression
Victor helped cope with the stress by drinking
due to his alcohol abuse, he eventually lost his job and was forced to undergo rehab
has been unable to find much work, working mostly labouring and other non-skilled work
Victor is hoping to earn enough money in order to move to another country and start anew 
a man of science, having little respect for native customs and beliefs
while he wouldn't admit it, he has various shaving cuts. This is due to him being unemployed for some time and not used to regularly shaving, but now trying to pass off as being (literally) clean cut

Potential mistakes/dishonesties:
he steps on evidence and drops things several times, which he does not own up to or admit, but Cailley notices
doesn't like to admit when he is wrong, particularly to non-scientifically/medically trained. When Cailley points out (at the second elk site) that there are no predator tracks, Victor replies that it could very well have been an eagle, and the large amounts of blood were caused by the elk trying in vain to fight off a flying creature. Cailley then asks why an eagle wouldn't attack instead in an open area, instead of where there is lots of tree cover. Victor replies that, unlike in the movies and TV, not everything at a crime scene will add up perfectly, and that there will often be conflicting pieces of evidence that need to be worked with



Stakes/wants:
get paid and get out of there
wants to escape his current position and start anew somewhere else
->
wants to make positive change, both by solving the island mystery and by helping Cailley 


How I view myself:
knows he is a has-been but doesn't freely admit it
->
realises he is trying to be who he was 20 years ago
he is not as old as he thought he was, and has a lot more to live


How I view the world:
pessimistic view of the world
too much bad in the world to make any real change for the good
->
sometimes the best thing you can do is help one person
great good is made up of many little goods
