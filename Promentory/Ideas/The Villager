Niq is piling rocks on top of his mother's body in the village cemetery, as part of a traditional funeral ceremony. The cemetery is an area on the outskirts of the village, surrounded by a crude fence made from driftwood, with graves marked by piles of rocks that usually stood about 6ft tall. Tok and Lok arrive, having just returned from hunting. They mention that their hunting was not successful, so they're going to see if they can help out with Tuq, who is fishing, and Niq decides to join them.

They arrive on the shore of a bay to find Tuq is having limit success with fishing. Niq looks out across the bay to a distant part of the island where there are some fairly bare trees, seeing a lone male elk (bull), and mentions this to the others. Tok says he suspects the elk was one that he and Lok were actually hunting, but had to call off their chase when it ran into the woods, lamenting that the village elders do not allow hunting in the woods, as it is the home to spirits they do not wish to anger.

The four of them go about pulling in the nets that Tuq has set and collecting the few caught fish into stone boxes along the shore. Most of the boxes sit empty, however, and Niq suggests they should go and hunt in the woods. The others seem interested, and Mak, a village senior, overhears them and tries to dissuade them. While the others think Mak is trying to protect the spirits, Mak suggests that most of the village respect and listen to the elders, and that disobeying them could split the village, which will ultimately be worse for the village than the current food shortage.

Mak suggests, instead, they make camp near the woods and set traps on the outskirts, thereby not encroaching on the woods and keeping the elders happy. He also suggests they move quickly, as the weather is uncharacteristically good for the time of year, and it won't stay that way for long. Furthermore, the recent snowstorm has left fresh snow on the ground that will make tracking elk easier.

As Niq is gathering some gear from his hut, and within sight of his mother's grave, he is approached by Gak, a village elder, and Mak, the senior who spoke with him while fishing. Gak expresses concern upon hearing that they are planning on hunting so close to the woods, worried that he will anger the spirits and doom the village. He insists that Mak go with them to make sure they don't encroach on the spirits' land. Mak gives Niq a knowing look, and Niq agrees to take Mak along.

As Niq and Mak head to the meeting point on the edge of town, Niq scolds him for telling the elders about their plan. Mak assures them they would have found out either way, and at least this way they believe Mak will be keeping an eye on them, as opposed to one of the elders insisting they do it themselves (or preventing the hunting expedition from occuring entirely).

They meet up with Tuq, who says Tok and Lok had already left to try to have a temporary camp set up by the time the rest got there. Niq, Tuq and Mak trek to the camp site. On the way, Mak talks about how he used to be of the same strict belief as the elders regarding the spirits of the island, but realised it was restricting the hunting and fishing grounds too much, which had essentially caused a self-imposed famine. Mak believes a number of deaths, including Niq's mother, can be attributed directly to malnourishment.

They arrive at the camp just as Tok and Lok are starting a fire. The camp is next to a stream that heads into the woods, and is only about 20 metres from the woods themselves. They are also within view of a cliff overlooking the sea, further around the coast from  where they were fishing earlier. Mak says that the heavy snowfall followed by warm weather will lead to rapidly melting snow, and begins work on building a trench to redirect water from the melting snow and protect their camp. Tuq decides to give him a hand, while Niq begins preparing to cook some of the fish they had caught earlier.

With Mak out of earshot, Tok and Lok mention to Niq that the reason they chose this camp site was so they could head into the woods to hunt without being seen from the village. Niq suggests that they may be able to get Mak on board with their plan, but suggests they attempt trying the original plan of setting traps on the outskirts of the woods before resorting to stepping foot in the woods, as there's no reason to risk getting caught "angering the spirits" if it ends up being unnecessary.

The group sit together under the stars eating the cooked fish, with the conversation mostly concerning the business of how and where to set traps and how to lure animals. The team agree on a plan and decide to call it a night, each laying down to sleep. Niq tries to sleep for awhile but is unable, stuck with thoughts of whether Mak was right, and that his mother could have been saved if she had not been so hungry. He heads over to the cliffs overlooking the sea and stars, and stares out at them, thinking about his mother.

After some time, he is joined by Tuq. She expresses her condolances about Niq's mother, and apologises for not being able to help in some way. Niq says he understands that she and the other fishermen are almost entirely relied upon to supply food for the village at the moment, so he understands that she has been incredibly busy lately. They look out at the sea and stars and talk about their childhood together, and the future of the village. They both express uncertainty as to whether the village was more vibrant when they were children, or whether they were just blissfully unaware of the problems happening arround them, and both fear that the village could actually be on the verge of collapse at the moment. They decide to both try to forget about the big picture for the moment and try to just focus on one thing at a time (being, currently, the hunt). They share a kiss and fall asleep where they lay.
