Set in fictional town of Promontory, small coastal town in very North Canada.

Victor is a vet sent to the town to investigate the mysterious deaths of a significant number of domesticated elk, which are farmed in Promontory.

Victor is an experienced vet in his 40s. He has been struggling for years to deal with the collapse of his marriage (which he believes was brought about because he was having an affair), and took the job on mostly as an excuse to go somewhere far away and secluded.

** The reason his marriage actually fell apart is because he has an addiction to opioids that he has access to through his job as a vet. Unbenownst to him, his wife didn't actually know about the affair.

Victor arrives in Promontory by boat, which is the only way to reach the town. Due to the rocky coastline and dangerous sea conditions, there are a litany of lights stationed on various rocky outcrops and bouys that boats use to navigate the treacherous waters.

Victor arrives in late September, when there are only a few hours on sunlight per day. It is also the month of the year with the most snowfall.

Victor books into a hotel to get some rest and try to get over his seasickness.

He meets with Pat. Pat is the farmer that Victor mostly deals with, who has lost a number of elk. He is in his late 20s, and took over the farm when his father died a few years prior.

Pat takes Victor to show the lastest victim. The elk carcass had been moved to a shed. It is mostly hard to recognise and has been almost entirely ripped apart. Victor notices that there seem to be some bite marks from the animal being eaten, but that they seem small enough to probably be scavengers and not the killer.

They visit the site where the elk was found, with Victor hoping he can find some tracks or other evidence. At the site they, there is not much on the ground, as there has been heavy snowfall. He does notice, however, some damaged trees nearby.

** The damage was actually caused by the very elk that died. There is a type of plant that actually grows in this particular climate. It looks innocent enough and is mostly harmless, except for a very rare flower that briefly appears on the plant when it is buried in snowfall (meaning this flower is rarely, if ever, seen). The flower quickly dies, leaving behind seeds that are distributed by animals walking through the snow, or spread as the snow melts into water. The flower, when mixed with water, is very toxic, resulting in any creature that drinks the mixture becoming increasingly aggressive, ultimately resulting in them thrashing about and literally tearing themselves apart.

** The very rare circumstances that need to occur for this plant to be mixed with water and ingested are for there to be significant snowfall (resulting in the flowers growing in the snow), then for there to be a period of warm weather that melts the snow before the flower dies (so melted snow mixes with the flower) and then drains into a body of water that an animal then drinks from.

** There are two abandoned settlements nearby: one is a very old Inuit village that was abandoned when some locals drank contaminated water. The surviving members of the settlement left, thinking the island was haunted or cursed in some way. The other settlement, much more modern, was a military research facility. It was quarantined and fenced off by the military when some locals drank contaminated water. They believed the town had been hit by some kind of contaigen or bio-weapon and so abandoned the inhabitants and covered up the existance of the facility.
