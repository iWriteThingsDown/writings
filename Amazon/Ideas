Set in fictional town of Promontory, small coastal town in very North Canada.

Victor is a vet sent to the town to investigate the mysterious deaths of a significant number of domesticated elk, which are farmed in Promontory.

Victor is an experienced vet in his 40s. He has been struggling for years to deal with the collapse of his marriage (which he believes was brought about because he was having an affair), and took the job on mostly as an excuse to go somewhere far away and secluded.

Pat is the farmer that Victor mostly deals with, who has lost a number of elk. He is in his late 20s, and took over the farm when his father died a few years prior.


Victor arrives in Promontory by boat, which is the only way to reach the town. Due to the dangerous rocky coastline, there are a litany of lights stationed on various rocky outcrops and bouys that boats use to navigate the treacherous waters.

Victor arrives in late September, when there are only a few hours on sunlight per day. It is also the month of the year with the most snowfall.
