Sketch is an interview, cut/edited together from spoken response and awkward singing of "Part of Your World" in a deep German accent.


So I was involved in The Little Mermaid from almost the very beginning.

At fist, Disney weren't interested. They felt it was too under-developed to stand on its own as a film, so we got to work on a rough script, some concept art, and the first song, which is what you're hearing now.

The executives looked over what we had and gave us the green light, and we were off.

One of the first things that was realised was just how many changes we would have to make to the original Hans Christian Anderson story, considering the audience was to be the children.

The first big change we made was turn the butler, Sebastian, into a Jamacian crab. We thought that would really open us up to some much more upbeat music and funny scenes with him.

The next change that was decided without my input, unfortunately, was to recast Ariel. Apparently my interpretation of the character wasn't getting good feedback from test audiences. They felt as though the children would react better to something a little less ... terrifying. So Jodi Benson was brought in, and I was recast as the grandmother.

Unfortunately, the next change that was made was that the grandmother was cut entirely to make room for other characters. I was offered the chance to play Ursula, but in order to secure the role, I had to beat Pat Carroll in the boxing ring. I wasn't aware at the time of Pat's previous career in bare knuckle boxing, so she knocked out three of my teeth and got the role.
